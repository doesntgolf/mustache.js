This is a fork of [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js), with the intended purpose of making tag key resolution more flexible. Rather than passing in a view (object where tag keys are looked up) as the second argument to `render`, a resolver function is passed in. (This is the plan; none of it has been implemented yet.) The way I plan on using it is doing JSON lookups with [jmespath](http://jmespath.org/) (this part wouldn't be all that different from regular mustache) and XML lookups with [xpath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath).
